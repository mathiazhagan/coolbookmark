                    <div class="t23"> A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO PROFESSIONAL STOCK VALUATION </div><br /><br />

                    <div class="t17">It is said, and most people would agree, that one of the most stressful instances in life is the buying or selling your home.<br /><br />

                        The same can most definitely be said for the sale or purchase of a business and because the last 'hurdle', prior to completion, is the Valuation of the Stock in Trade, we feel it is our responsibility to ensure the Business Transfer is concluded smoothly and efficiently, with the minimum of fuss and concern to both Vendors and Purchasers. For that reason we have produced this Brief Introduction to the manner in which a Professional Stock Valuation is conducted for the purpose of Business Transfers.</div>

                    <div class="t23"> THE VALUER </div><br /><br />

                    <div class="t17">Whether buying or selling, it is in your interest to deal with an established, experienced and reputable Stock Valuation Company, preferably adhering to the Code of Conduct and ethics laid down by The Trade Valuers Institute, which is responsible for the proper conduct and integrity of Valuers undertaking transfers valuations of stock of any kind. When you use the services of National Stocktakers you are guaranteed the attendance of a Member of The T.V.I., with a minimum of five years experience practising as a Valuer, or a Valuer who has the necessary experience and competence to undertake your Stock in Trade Valuation having undergone our own internal Assessment procedures .</div>

                    <div class="t23"> VALUING </div><br /> <br /> 

                    <div class="t17">In whatever field, most businessmen/women experienced in the buying and selling of goods that involves some element of stockholding will appreciate just how many factors must be taken into account when valuing stock. However, many newcomers and first time buyers, and occasionally those trades-persons who simply count and cost their goods, rather than having them "valued", do not.<br /><br />

                        <b>A professional Valuer will, among other things, take into account such factors as, buying power, quality, age, condition and retail pricing, etc.</b><br /><br />

                        However, by far the most important factor these days is the date coding of goods and we must stress to Purchasers and Vendors alike, that the majority of out of date goods have no value whatsoever, as indeed do unsaleable goods of any nature.</div>

                    <div class="t23"> COUNTING </div><br /><br />

                    <div class="t17">Despite uniformed opinion to the contrary, <b>the majority of stock is accurately counted.</b><br /><br />

                        However, quantities and/or weights of certain goods, such as jars of sweets and children's sweets are assessed, as are buttons in a Haberdashery, loose nails in an Ironmongers and some meats and cheeses in a Dairy, to name a few examples.<br /><br />

                        Where the Purchaser and/or Vendor insist the above and similar be weighed or counted an extra person will be supplied to undertake that specific task. However, the cost of providing the additional person will be extra to our general fee.</div>

                    <div class="t23"> VALUATION </div><br /> <br /> 

                    <div class="t17">By employing the services of a professional Valuer you can be assured of receiving an <b>impartial and independent valuation.</b><br /> <br />

                        It is part of the Valuer's mandate to arrive at a fair result for the party or parties they are representing, on <b>ALL</b> occasions and without exception. Please also note, where both Purchaser and Vendor choose to appoint separate 'Valuers', a professional Valuer will only enter into negotiations with another professional of The Trade Valuers Institute or of a similar body as recognised by The Trade Valuers Institute. A Professional Valuer is the only person properly qualified to value your stock and it will be his judgment and expertise which will be accepted in determining the Valuation.<br /> <br />

                        Subject to any qualifying clauses in the Sale Contract specifically effecting the Valuation, for the vast majority of business transfers, the basis for the valuation of stock would normally be - 'Stock in Trade at the lower of cost or nett realisable value'.<br /> <br />

                        Should there be any contractually qualifying clauses, their meaning will be adopted by the Valuer in both his deliberations and calculations, as may apply. With regard to the terminology used in the Sale Contract, which is likely to be 'stock at valuation', or similar, it is important to recognise that value and cost are not necessarily the same thing in terms of a valuation. Whilst there is undoubtedly a known cost at the time of any purchase, the value or worth of the good(s) involved can be influenced by many factors, not least of all those mentioned earlier, such as age, condition and quantity, etc.</div>

                    <div class="t23"> PLEASE NOTE </div><br /> <br /> 


                    <div class="t17">The Valuer/s present, will endeavour to check all dated stock. Any stock found out of date will be ignored. The valuer/s will also check for near dated stock. The value of near dated stock depends on what type of stock it is and the length of time left.</div>

                    <div class="t23"> WHAT DO YOU RECEIVE </div><br /> <br /> 

                    <div class="t17"><b>PRIOR</b> to the Valuation, upon receipt of your enquiry or, as is in the majority of cases, your instructions, verbal or in writing, you will receive the following, by return: A LETTER - thanking you for your enquiry/instructions confirming our appointment, the planned date of attendance and our Fee.<br /> <br /> 
                        ON THE DAY of attendance, following the completion of the Valuation, and before our Valuer leaves the premises, you will receive:<br /> <br /> </div>

                    <div class="list2">
                        <ul>
                            <li> A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO PROFESSIONAL STOCK VALUATION </li><br /> 
                            <li> An AUTHORISATION NOTE, requiring your signature, which is your instruction to us to undertake the Valuation of the Stock in Trade at the appropriate time and date which, additionally, describes the basis of the valuation and confirms some of the points mentioned both in this Guide and other accompanying literature. </li><br />

                            <li> A QUALITY CONTROL QUESTIONNAIRE, together with a pre-paid addressed envelope, which we would ask you to complete and return, together with any constructive comments or observations you may have. AFTER the transfer date: A - STOCK BREAKDOWN SUMMARY, by category and net value, will be forwarded to the Purchaser shortly after the takeover, once processed at our offices. </li>					
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="t17">(In the event the Vendor requires a copy please inform the Valuer in attendance and provide a forwarding address) </div>

                    <div class="t23"> QUESTIONS? </div><br /> <br /> 

                    <div class="t17">If you have any questions please contact the our office prior to the date of Transfer.

                    <div class="t23"> SOME DO'S AND DON'TS </div><br /> 

                    <div class="list2">
                        <ul>
                            <li> Do - make sure the Transfer date is the same as that of completion, excepting those cases where either, the Solicitors have agreed otherwise or monies have been deposited and your Solicitor(s) are aware and advised beforehand. E.g. Stock transferred on a week-end pending completion of all formalities' normal' business hours Monday. </li><br />
                            <li> Do - make sure you at present at the beginning and end of the Valuation, particularly at the end, as you will be required to sign the legal document(s) to finalise the transaction. Although your presence is not required during the Valuation you are free to remain. </li><br />
                            <li> Do - make sure that all Wholesalers and other Suppliers you are ceasing or continuing to use are aware of the takeover and the date.<br />(This particularly applies to Newspaper Wholesalers) </li><br />
                            <li> Do - make sure which goods are 'Sale and Return', 'Sale or Exchange' and/or 3rd Party Goods which are not in the ownership of the business. </li><br />
                            <li> Do - make sure the Valuer is shown all areas of stockholding and remember some items, such as some empty bottles, etc, do have a deposit value. </li><br />
                            <li> Do - send off all 'money off' vouchers etc, prior to our attendance. </li><br />
                            <li> Do - (to the Vendor) make sure all unsaleable and 'Out of Date' stock is removed from your shelves. In the case of those goods which are 'On Consignment', ie only paid for as sold, it is essential their existence is clearly and specifically drawn to the Valuers attention. Whilst the Valuer in attendance on the day will attempt to ensure, in part, that the above issues have been accommodated it is not his final responsibility in terms of the Valuation. </li><br />
                            <li> Don't - try and tell the Valuer how to discount or what is over-priced, etc. This is what you are paying him to do and his decision is final. </li><br />
                            <li> Don't - allow one party to undertake their own 'Valuation'. They are NOT Valuers and a Valuer will not discuss his Valuation except with another recognised Valuer. </li><br />
                            <li> Don't - wait for the Valuer to tell him you do not wish to purchase particular saleable goods. This is a contractual matter and must be agreed beforehand. </li><br />


                        </ul>

                    <div class="t23"> ANNUAL, INTERIM OR PERIODIC STOCKTAKING </div><br /> <br /> 

                    <div class="t17"><b>ANNUAL STOCKTAKES</b> are a necessary requirement for all businesses that hold Stock in Trade. For your Accountant, Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise. Our fee for carrying out an 'Annual' is normally about half that of a Transfer, with a minimum fee, and is carried out at your financial year end Our Stocktakers are fully trained, most of them Members of The Trade Valuers Institute<br /> <br /> 

                        <b>INTERIM STOCKTAKES</b> are normally undertaken at the request of the Client to either 'keep his hand on the tiller' or, as is more often the case when discussing matters with the Bank Manager for re-financing or expansion. Our fees would normally be about the same as for an Annual.<br /> <br /> 

                        <b>PERIODIC STOCKTAKES</b> can be undertaken for a variety of reasons but are normally would be for the purpose of monitoring and controlling stock 'shrinkage' and it's effects. These are usually undertaken at 'Retail' with the opening stocks plus purchases less closing stock providing the theoretical takings for the period for comparison with the actual. The subsequent deficit being the 'shrinkage' suffered by the business in that period. Our fees in this instance will reflect our involvement in producing the period result.<br /> <br /> 

                        However, if we are required to only 'take stock' and report the retail stock figure to Management, our fee would be about that of Annual. All Customers of National Stocktakers have free admittance to our online customer services. These are being constantly updated and added to.</div>

                    <div class="t23"> CANCELLATION </div><br /> <br /> 

                    <div class="t17">Please note, once you book and we have confirmed the date of attendance with you, there is no charge for cancelling provided we have been notified no less than five days in advance. Less than five days and cancellation is subject to the following fees: 4 days notice - 25%, 3 days - 50%, 2 days or less - the minimum fee is payable.</div>
